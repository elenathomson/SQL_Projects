# SQL_Projects
This repository contains projects I created using SQL.

My first SQL project created using DataCamp project about the oldest businesses in the world. In this project I used queries to manipulate data and join three different datasets to discover the oldest businesses around the world.
What and Where Are the World's Oldest Businesses? https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/1168
[ Here is the code ](Old_businesses/MyProjectSQL_OldBusiness.sql)
[ Here is the pdf file with outcome ](Old_businesses/SQL_Project_OldestBusinesses.pdf)


In a second project I analyse international debt data collected by The World Bank.
I have answered next questions:
- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
